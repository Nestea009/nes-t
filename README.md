# My Website

Previously I had another website at nestea009.github.io, however, it sucked ass.

That's why, I created a better one from scratch, which is what this proyect is. 

It is currently not available in any URL because it is still in a very early face, however it will be in a near future (hopefully).

That's it, have a nice day, bye.
